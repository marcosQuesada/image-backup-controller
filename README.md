// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Assumptions
 Initial assumptions are:
- pods are already running in the cluster, so that Deployments/Statefulsets are expected to be Ready
- we are just interested in crete/update events
- restrict events from banned namespaces (kube-proxy)
- we are not interested in any other workload types (Jobs/CronJobs as example will use images too)

From the original assumptions we can define what are the events that we want to watch, predicates will implement each one of the restrictions
Overall idea is that we just execute Reconcile when an image backup must be generated and rollout

## Development Process
 First development choice was to implement 2 separate controllers, watching deployments and daemonsets.
 In both cases they are checking used images (initContainers and containers specs), and this was enough to execute backup generation against our backupRegistry.
 Once backup is completed it just updates deployment/daemonset spec forcing rolling update.

 But, this basic scenario has big improvement space IMHO, on the situation that we need to increase concurrency, it could potentially happen that we will create an image backup more than once at the same time,
example: 
 Slow backup process is started and we receive another event from the same resource, basic controller implementation it's not aware of current backup executions.

 This opens the space to a more 'traditional' implementation thinking in how Deployemtns/ReplicaSets/Pods are tied together in a colaborative way each one with its own controller,
and so I created a CRD type and a controller that take the responsibility on generating backup images, delegating deployment/dameonset controllers just as imageBackup object producers.
The flow will work as:
- deployment/daemonset watches for objects on ready state from a non restricted namespaces
- on create/update event controller checks if exists an ImageBackup object created for that
  - if none is found it will create it / if it's already created it does nothing then
- ImageBackup controller process image backup executions progressing the CRD Status
  - Think on object deletion // @TODO:

 Project scaffolding:
```
kubebuilder init --domain k8slab.io --repo github.com/marcosQuesada/image-backup-controller
kubebuilder create api --group k8slab.io --version v1alpha1 --kind Deployment
kubebuilder create api --group k8slab.io --version v1alpha1 --kind DaemonSet
kubebuilder create api --group k8slab.io --version v1alpha1 --kind ImageBackup
```
Define ImageBackup CRD, generate deepCopy and manifests
```
make generate
make manifests
```


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/image-backup-controller:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/image-backup-controller:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
